# Calculator
This simple Calculator supports multiple operations (sum, subtract, multiply, divide).
Depending on the parameter passed to the application, we have two different user experiences:
1.- INTERACTIVE: the user is presented with a simple menu where he can chose the operation he wants to perform
2.- USING PARAMETERS: in this case, as a parameters we can pass to the application the type of the operation and the input file where the arguments are saved
